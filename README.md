Centrifugal pump curve is a file that removes the hustle for plotting characteristic curves of a centrifugal pump

The program takes in several dimensions of the pump. Asks you how many points do you want to insert from the curve given by the
manufacturer. Then asks you to intake several values from the experimental setup, and after that you can insert the measured values,
as many measured values as you would like. Then using the Principles of Similrarity it calcultes the curve for the corresponding rpm of 
the manufacturer. 
Using the matplotlib, numpy and scipy it plots the curves, using interpolation, applied to the input values, and finnaly outputs the 
required plot.

This prorgram is very usefull when using analog instrumentation, and perhaps checking some excel work.
